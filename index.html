  <h1>Who I Am</h1>
  <p>
	The AMS exists to serve students, period. But we can't do that without your buy-in. The AMS saw a voter turnout of 6.9% last year with 4 out of 5 executives running uncontested.
	Voter turnout as a whole is decreasing. </p>
	<br>
	<p>When it comes to AMS representing student financial interests, students continue to be
	more likely to disagree (33%) than agree (27%) as well as when trusting AMS to spend
	their money wisely (37% disagree, 25% agree).</p>
	<p></p>
	<br>

	<p>
		56% of undergraduate students are satisfied with their UBC experience, a significant drop from the 70% satisfaction rate over the past five years. 
	To make matters worse, the pandemic has left many of us feeling isolated, lost, and disconnected from regular university life. 
	</p>
	 <p></p>
	 <br>

	<p>
		I wish that was the extent of it. We are also in a climate emergency, faced with extreme wealth inequality, and continued oppression of Indigenous, Black, and people of colour. Students are currently faced with so many different obstacles - but we can get through it together. 
	The VP Academic and University Affairs should always prioritize student needs first. 
	I'm running to do exactly that - on a platform centered on compassion, care, and community. 
	</p>
	<p></p>
	<br>

	<p>
		Over the past year, I have gained valuable experience as a student staff in the AMS - mainly in strategy, governance, and policy. I have worked on many different projects, including a huge revision of our Sexual Violence and Respectful Community and Workplace Policies, the AMS Strategic Plan, and a governance review of AMS Council to ensure we are working efficiently and effectively, while maintaining accountability and transparency with the student body. 
	Through this work, I have also seen many of the gaps that currently exist within the AMS and with our relationship with the student body. I also spent two years at UBC outside of the AMS, which allows me to view these issues through the lens of an average student. 	
	I also have leadership experience in various areas - as the first ever Diversity and Equity Coordinator for UBC Improv, I am honored to say that I have been able to champion our equity efforts internally and externally, while creating space for marginalized folks in theater and performance at UBC. 	
		</p>

		<br>

	<p>
			I have always been passionate about grassroots organizing and advocacy - as a woman of colour, I have first-hand experience and a deep connection to many of the issues I will advocate for. However, I am also committed to constantly listening, learning, and un-learning - work that, in my opinion, is never done. Your voice is integral to what we do as a student union. I'm running to make sure students are consistently informed, engaged, and no one is left behind.

								As your VP Academic and Senate representative, I will push for a Student Engagement Campaign to raise awareness on what these bodies do, how their policies affect you, and how you can get involved and make your voice heard. This includes all things AMS as well - transparency and accountability are key to rebuilding trust with the student body and are integral to our mission as a student union.

								If elected, I will continue to oppose tuition increases without a long-term Student Affordability Plan from UBC and better tuition consultation processes.
								<br>
								<br>
								Thankfully, this work is getting started with the Student Affordability Taskforce - however this is a slow process and this issue needs the urgency it deserves. Students are struggling and need support now. 
								<br>
								<br>
								We need better tuition consultation, following current recommendations from the SATF.
								<br>
								<br>
							
								We need more transparency with where our finances are going - especially when it comes to important issues such as the climate emergency - it’s time that UBC puts their money where their mouth is. 
								<br>

								According to the 2021 Academic Experience Survey, the average amount spent on textbooks was $893, with a median of $400.Continue advocating for the use of Open Educational Resources (OERs) in all faculties and courses to alleviate financial burdens on students.

									According to UBC's Wayfinding program, 49 buildings out of the 189 on campus are inaccessible. Of the 140 remaining, 50 have no information on accessibility.

									Get UBC to commit to establishing an accessibility taskforce to address accessibility issues - this can be through a task force between the BoG and Senate.

									<br>
									Invest in making buildings accessible, as well as improving the Wayfinding Interface. Mandate regular accessibility audits 
									<br>
									<br>
									We currently have commitments to universal accessibility in the Vancouver Campus Plan - this has to be a priority in Campus Vision 2050, our land-use plan for the next 30 years. 
									<br>
									<br>
									“To ensure the equal participation by people of all abilities in the future, The Campus Plan goes beyond basic compliance with accessibility standards. It seeks to create a barrier-free campus by encouraging the application of universal design principles in planning and designing new facilities, major renovations and retrofits to facilities and the public realm.”

									Campus Vision 2050: “Academic building space that supports a range of flexible teaching and learning environments, including hybrid in-person and online formats.”
									<br>
									<br>
									Accessibility has to be looked at holistically and in all forms. This includes physical and learning spaces. Having the option of flexible and hybrid learning ensures that students can access an education - especially during a pandemic where students may be at higher risk, immunocompromised, or at risk of passing COVID-19 to those at risk.
